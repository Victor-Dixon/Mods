📢 **CitiesRegional Devlog - Three Major Tasks Complete!** 🎮

Hey CS2 modding community! Just finished three major tasks for the CitiesRegional mod:

✅ **1. Trade Matching Algorithm**
- Connection-based matching (only trades between connected cities)
- Capacity constraint handling (85% utilization limit)
- Distance/travel time limits (configurable, default 60 minutes)
- Priority-based optimization (distance, capacity, congestion, price, scale)
- Enhanced TradeFlow model (ConnectionId, TravelTimeMinutes, CalculatedAt)

✅ **2. Trade Flow Calculation Enhancement**
- Created TradeFlowCalculator service with comprehensive statistics
- Per-resource, per-city, per-connection statistics
- Trade flow validation with error reporting
- Detailed logging and performance tracking
- Integrated with RegionalManager

✅ **3. Multi-City Testing**
- Created comprehensive test suite (6 test scenarios)
- Tests cover 2-city, 3-city, multi-resource, capacity, and validation
- All tests compile successfully
- Ready for in-game validation

✅ **4. UI Framework Setup (Research)**
- Researched Gooee/React integration for CS2
- Created UI_FRAMEWORK_SETUP.md with implementation plan
- Ready for Gooee package integration

**Progress:** 78% → 82% (+4%)

**Files Created:**
- src/Services/TradeFlowCalculator.cs
- CitiesRegional.Tests/IntegrationTests/MultiCityTradeTests.cs
- UI_FRAMEWORK_SETUP.md
- TRADE_MATCHING_ALGORITHM.md

**Tech Stack:**
- BepInEx 5 + HarmonyX
- Unity ECS/DOTS
- .NET Standard 2.1
- xUnit for testing
