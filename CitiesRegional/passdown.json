  "scope_completed": [
    "Added reflection-only Gooee API probe ([GooeeProbe]) and wired it into the placeholder Gooee plugin startup logging",
    "Updated Gooee API testing guide and research notes to reference probe markers",
    "Made logging test-safe outside Unity/BepInEx by using reflection-based Unity logging fallback and Console fallback",
    "Made ResourceData export/import defaults consistent (derived from production/consumption unless explicitly set)",
    "Adjusted log analyzer to recognize CitiesRegional entries in BepInEx logs and gated log-dependent validations behind an opt-in env var"

  "decisions_made": [
    "Use reflection-only Gooee probing to avoid compile-time dependency on deprecated/unstable Gooee API",
    "Keep log-driven integration validations opt-in to ensure deterministic CI/unit test execution"

  "tradeoffs": [
    "Gooee API availability is verified via runtime logs rather than compile-time typing, reducing compile-time guarantees but improving compatibility",
    "Computed export/import defaults can be overridden by explicit values; the implicit default is based on production/consumption for consistency"
